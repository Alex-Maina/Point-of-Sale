This is a simple CLI Driven E-commerce System

The customer-product system is based on
customers, products, and purchases made
by customers. Our purpose in this project is
to implement a Python program that starts
with a menu, get customer's choices, and
process them. This program will assist in
managing customer and product data in the
system, as well as enable customers to buy certain
products if there are enough items from that
product in the system.
